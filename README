Testing notes:
CAUTION: If you are intending to run integration tests you should pip install cloudify before the test-requirements.txt or you may have dependency version issues (e.g. wrong versions of jinja2).
# TODO: No caution note, just rewrite this to say what to install first.
1. For unit tests, `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`, then run `pytest tests`

2. For integration tests you must `pip install cloudify`, at least version 4.4.0; you must also have a pre-created manager of the appropriate version.
  # TODO: And fill in the config file, but we need to create a basic version of that first.
