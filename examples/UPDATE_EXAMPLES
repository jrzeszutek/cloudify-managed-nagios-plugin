### Preparation
# See README for necessary preparation steps.
# It is recommended that each set of examples be run only after cleaning up any previous examples.

### Update examples
# All examples in this section require a deployed nagios server
# This can be accomplished using:
helper_scripts/deploy_nagios update-1
# Cleaning up:
# When you wish to remove nagios, you should clear all test nodes and then run the following command.
# It is recommended that this is done after uninstalling all of these examples and before trying other examples.
helper_scripts/remove_nagios
cfy blueprints delete nagios
cfy blueprints delete nagiosupdate-2


#### 1 Adding a new target type example
# WARNING: Both update examples are designed to be run one after the other
# This demonstrates adding a new target type to nagios
# We can't have a monitored node yet because we have no target types
# So we'll first add a target type, by uploading a blueprint with one we want:
cfy blueprints upload -b nagiosupdate-2 blueprints/nagios-update-2.yaml
# And now we'll add the target type by updating the deployment
# As we're only adding a target type, rather than changing anything associated with an
# existing one, we don't need to do anything else with the nagios deployment
cfy deployments update -b nagiosupdate-2 nagios
# Now we can deploy a monitored instance
cfy install -b baseupdate -d baseupdate -i snmptest-blueprint-inputs.yaml blueprints/baseupdate.yaml
# And we'll set the monitored value
ssh -A -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy deployment outputs nagios | grep -A1 "External " | grep Value | awk '{ print $2 }') ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no centos@$(cfy node-instances get $(cfy node-instances list | grep baseupdate | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2 }') | grep ip: | awk '{ print $2 }') echo 10 '">"' /tmp/cloudifytestinteger
# But there will be no reaction because the threshold is incorrect
# You should now proceed to the second example to update the threshold


#### 2 Updating existing check thresholds
# WARNING: You MUST run the previous example before this one.
# This demonstrates updating a check for an already existing target type, e.g. to adapt
# to changing requirements.
# Now that we've realised that the threshold is wrong, we'll need to update the check:
cfy blueprints upload -b nagiosupdate-3 blueprints/nagios-update-3.yaml
# Next we need to update the deployment. Because the target type aggregates checks, the
# deployment update will not automatically reinstall the specific target type, so we must
# tell it to do this:
cfy deployments update nagios -b nagiosupdate-3 -r $(cfy node-instances list | grep base_update_instance | awk '{ print $2 }')
# After the target type is updated, it will have lost the associated targets so we must reconcile
# (see BASE_EXAMPLES for a reconcile example):
cfy executions start -d nagios -p '{"node_ids": ["nagios"],"operation": "cloudify.interfaces.reconcile.monitoring","allow_kwargs_override": true}' execute_operation
# And shortly, the monitoring should detect that the threshold is exceeded and heal
for i in {1..60}; do if ! cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | grep baseupdate ; then sleep 2; else break; fi; done; cfy events list --tail -e $(cfy executions list | grep heal | grep started | awk '{ print $2 }')
# Cleaning up
cfy uninstall baseupdate

# Don't forget to run the nagios cleanup before you try another example
